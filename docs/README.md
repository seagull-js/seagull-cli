# Seagull Documentation

This is an integrated github-pages documentation built on jekyll's
[cayman theme](https://github.com/jasonlong/cayman-theme). Github will
automatically (re-)build the [website](https://seagull-js.github.io/seagull-cli/)
whenever content within this `docs` folder changes.

## Local Docs development

You will need ruby installed, together with the gems `jekyll` and `bundler`.
Then `cd` into this directory and run `bundle install` once. Afterwards you
can execute `bundle exec jekyll serve --watch` for a live-reloading web server
that updates whenever you change some text files here.
